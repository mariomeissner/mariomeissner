### Hello!

I'm a Machine Learning ðŸ¤– researcher and engineer, currently working on Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I'm exploring the shortcut-learning behavior of transformer models, and finding better debiasing techniques to help models avoid spurious correlations in the data. Feel free to visit my [blog](https://mariomeissner.github.io/) or have a look at some of my repositories!

âœ¨ If you're struggling to keep your huggingface experiment code organized, try using a lightning-hydra template! I adapted the popular [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template) for my own needs, adding support for huggingface transformers. Life made easy! Find it below.
