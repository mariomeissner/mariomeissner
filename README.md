### Hello!

I'm a Full Stack Engineer currently working for Indeed Japan. Formerly, I was a master's student and researcher in the field of NLP.

Specifically, I explored the **shortcut-learning behavior of transformer models**, and found better debiasing techniques to help models avoid learning from unintended spurious correlations in the data. Feel free to visit my [blog](https://mariomeissner.dev) or have a look at some of my repositories!

I am open to freelancing, startups, and any other kind of collaborations involving web development or ML engineering. Send me an email!

âœ¨ If you're struggling to keep your huggingface experiment code organized, try using my opinionated [lightning-hydra](https://github.com/mariomeissner/lightning-hydra-transformers) template! I adapted it from the popular template by [ashleve](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template). The most important change is the added support for HuggingFace `transformers`. Life made easy! Find it below.
